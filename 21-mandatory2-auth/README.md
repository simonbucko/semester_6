# Considerations

I have already in my life worked with Google, Facebook and Linkedin OAuth solutions. Here is some of my personal opinions and considerations why I have picked Github to integrate with for this project

## Google

Its is one of the greatest and mosed used OAuth integrations. With its popularity it is very easy to find open source packages that helps one to integrate the login in easy and fast manner and partially hide the flow behind it. Only disadvantage is that the process of setting the login app in google is a bit complicated with many steps and one can easily make mistake in those steps

## Facebook

Its is one of the greatest and mosed used OAuth integrations. With its popularity it is very easy to find open source packages that helps one to integrate the login in easy and fast manner and partially hide the flow behind it. Only disadvantage is that I found the documentation a bit confuding when implementing it and UI seemed a bit not inutitive when I was setting the login app for the first time inf facebook

## Linkedin

Its is one of the biggest social media when it comest to working industry, but its not that much popular when implementing OAuth login. Therefore I found myself doing everything from scratch according the documentation without help of open source packages. Also one thing I did not like was there way they authenticate you app, which can take up to some hours or days

## Guthub

Never worked with github in my life, so i though it would be great to try it out during this project. I found it super easy and straight forward to set up the login app on github, without overwheling endless steps as for example in google. So I liked the overall experience with gitub, but the only problem with github is, that only developer have account at github
